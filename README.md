# Arduino Sensors

This repo contains simple test scripts and schemas to test various sensors with the Arduino.

## Arduinos

The following Arduinos are being tested with this code, and schemas provided for wiring with the schemas:

* Arduino Uno R3

## Sensors

The following sensors are being tested with this code and schemas provided for wiring with the schemas:

* Light Intensity Sensor Module 5528 Photo Resistor
* Hygrometer (LM393 Compatible) Module with Probe
* DHT11 Temperature and Relative Humidity Sensor Module

## Code

The code is contained in individual INO files that can be compiled and uploaded to the Arduino to test the functionality of one sensor at a time. See the [/code](/code) directory for the list of tests.

## Schemas

All of the schemas were created using the [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) software. See the [/schemas](/schemas) directory for the list of schemas.
